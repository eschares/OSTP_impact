# OSTP_impact

This site hosts the underlying data for an analysis of the impact of the 2022 OSTP memo. The updated guidance eliminates the 12-month embargo period on publications arising from U.S. federal funding.

This analysis looks at five years of publications from 2017-2021 to investigate the characteristics of those research outputs that would have fallen under this updated guidance.

Topics include
- Funders
- Publishers
- Journal titles
- Research institutions
- Open Access status

Each of the above has its own data file, which includes
- Absolute number of U.S. federally funded (FF) publications
- Absolute number of total publications
- Percentage of FF publications
- Open Access status of FF publications, by absolue number and percentage

A website at [lib.iastate.edu](https://lib.iastate.edu) hosts interactive versions of each plot included in the paper, with dynamic labeling and color-coding to highlight user-defined points.
