This is a revised and expanded version of data that supports the research study at https://doi.org/10.1162/qss_a_00237.

Data were collected August 28-30, 2023 from the paid version of Digital Scienceâ€™s Dimensions platform, available at https://app.dimensions.ai. Both the web interface and the API were used.

Search query was:
Year: 2016-2022

Custom filter to remove "front matter": editorials, cover photo, cover picture, titelbild, etc.

Note: a known issue is the inclusion of "Supplementary" material. This was not separated out due to technical issues. The inclusion of this material adds 0.3% to the total US Federally Funded (FF) publication counts from 2016-2022.
