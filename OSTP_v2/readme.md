This is a revised and expanded version of data that supports the research study at https://doi.org/10.1162/qss_a_00237.

Data were collected August 28 - September 1, 2023 from the paid version of Digital Scienceâ€™s Dimensions platform, available at https://app.dimensions.ai. Both the web interface and the API were used.

Basic search query was:
- Year: 2016-2022
- Publication Type: NOT preprint
- Funder group: US Federal Funders
- Custom filter applied to remove "front matter": editorials, cover photo, cover picture, titelbild, etc.

Note: a known issue is the inclusion of "Supplementary" material. This was not separated out due to technical issues. The inclusion of this material adds 0.3% to the total US Federally Funded (FF) publication counts from 2016-2022.

### Updates:
- 8/31/23: Added Research Organizations file, `ResOrgs_v2.xlsx`.
  - Main sheet is `summary_pastevalues`. Flat file that contains information on 1150 research organizations, including R1s, R2s, HBCUs, HSIs, NASNTIs, AANAPISIs as defined in Dimensions.
  - ResOrg group definitions from Dimensions (R1, R2, HBCUs, HSIs, NASNTIs, AANAPISIs) shown in sheet `ResOrg-group_definitions`
  - File started with an export of the top 500 orgs in terms of number of FF pubs, 2016-2022 summed.
  - In some cases, a ResOrg from a group was in the initial pull of top 500. That org was not looked up using the API. Other (smaller) orgs were specifically searched for in the API and added to the bottom of the sheet.

## Overall Numbers:
- The sum of US FF papers over the years 2016-2022 is **1,950,355**, and the average number of US FF papers per year is **278,622**.
- The number of US FF papers increased each year from 2016-2021, but decreased in 2022. This matches the trend seen from all US publications and output from two European funding groups. The number of worldwide publications continued to increase in 2022.
- The US FF rate of change ranged from a 5.4% increase (2019-2020) to an 8% decrease (2021 to 2022). The average rate of increase over all six years studied here was 0.5%. Excluding the 2022 decrease, the average rate of increase was 2.3% YoY.
- The so-called "Covid spike" of publications in 2020 is seen as increases in all groups here, ranging from 11.3-5.4%.

- US FF publications make up around 36% of all US output, ranging from 35.6% to 37.4% in an individual year.
- All US output makes up around 13.5% of all worldwide output over 2016-2022, ranging from 11.8-15.8% in an individual year.
- Therefore, US FF publications make up nearly 5% of all worldwide output over the 7 years studied here, ranging from 4.2-5.9% in an individual year.
