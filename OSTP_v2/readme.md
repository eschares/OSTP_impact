This is a revised and expanded version of data that supports the research study at https://doi.org/10.1162/qss_a_00237.

Data were collected August 28 - September 1, 2023 from the paid version of Digital Science’s Dimensions platform, available at https://app.dimensions.ai. Both the web interface and the API were used.

Basic search query was:
- Year: 2016-2022
- Publication Type: NOT preprint
- Funder group: US Federal Funders
- Custom filter applied to remove "front matter": editorials, cover photo, cover picture, titelbild, etc.

Note: a known issue is the inclusion of "Supplementary" material. This was not separated out due to technical issues. The inclusion of this material adds 0.3% to the total US Federally Funded (FF) publication counts from 2016-2022.

## Overall Numbers:
- The sum of US FF papers over the years 2016-2022 is **1,950,355**, and the average number of US FF papers per year is **278,622**.
- The number of US FF papers increased each year from 2016-2021, but decreased in 2022. This matches the trend seen from all US publications and output from two European funding groups. The number of worldwide publications continued to increase in 2022.
- The US FF rate of change ranged from a 5.4% increase (2019-2020) to an 8% decrease (2021 to 2022). The average rate of increase over all six years studied here was 0.5%. Excluding the 2022 decrease, the average rate of increase was 2.3% YoY.
- The so-called "Covid spike" of publications in 2020 is seen as increases in all groups here, ranging from 11.3-5.4%.

- US FF publications make up around 36% of all US output, ranging from 35.6% to 37.4% in an individual year.
- All US output makes up around 13.5% of all worldwide output over 2016-2022, ranging from 11.8-15.8% in an individual year.
- Therefore, US FF publications make up nearly 5% of all worldwide output over the 7 years studied here, ranging from 4.2-5.9% in an individual year.
